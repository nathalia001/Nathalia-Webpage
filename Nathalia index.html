<h2> What I am Doing Today </h2>
<p> Hello, my name is Nathalia and I am a junior at Radford School. I am 16 years old and I love tho read.
 Something that I really enjoy and am always doing is photography.
 I love to take picures of nature, art, architecture and places that I have traveled.
 In addition I also enjoy making small movies of my adventures. 
 I think that a picure is worth a thousand words and I really try to capure that in my photography.</p>

<h2> My Passion </h2>
<p> I am a readerand I really love to read fantasy. My favorite books are the Harry Potter series. 
I have gone to Harry Potter world in Ornado and LA. I am a really big part of the community that the world has built and I am really proud of it.
I also really like to keep up with the new things that are going on in the Wizarding World Community. But keep quiet we cant let the muggles find out we exist.</p>
